# Generated by CHARMM-GUI (http://www.charmm-gui.org)

# This folder contains AMBER formatted CHARMM36 force fields, a pre-optimized PDB structure, and AMBER inputs.
# All input files were optimized for AMBER16 or above, so lower version of AMBER can cause some errors.
# CHARMM36 FF to AMBER format conversion was done by ParmEd, written by Jason Swails and available at
# http://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd. In this script, the parallel (MPI) version is commented out. Use this line
# for parallel execution instead (adjust for your MPI and the number of CPUs you want to use). Alternatively,
# if you have access to pmemd.cuda or are willing to use sander, you can replace "pmemd" with pmemd.cuda or sander and
# "pmemd.MPI" with pmemd.cuda.MPI or sander.MPI
#
# There is a known issue in current CHARMM-GUI AMBER inputs with "sander".
# If you are willing to use "sander" for your simulation, please remove "&end" line in all minimization / equilibration
# inputs.

# In the case that there is a problem during minimization using a pmemd.cuda, please try to use pmemd only for
